I developed an e-commerce website. The application follows a monolithic architecture with the frontend consuming a RESTful API. To optimize SEO, I incorporated Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). To enhance scalability, I adhered to Clean Architecture and SOLID principles. Moreover, I improved accessibility by implementing ARIA attributes.

The completed project was successfully deployed to production using Vercel. <br/>
